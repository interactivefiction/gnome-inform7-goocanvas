GooCanvas 1.0.0	(Jan 10 2011)
===============

 o Added "alpha" property to GooCanvasImage to set opacity.
 o Allow setting clip path to NULL to reset it.
 o Allow setting line dash to NULL to reset it.
 o Handle RTL direction better in GooCanvasTable.
 o Fixed GooCanvasGroup bug - use the correct scale argument in paint.
 o Fixed GooCanvasPolyline bug - update arrows when line width changes.
 o Fixed static items bug - don't clip incorrectly.
 o Improved performance a bit when creating lots of items.


GooCanvas 0.15	(Jun 29 2009)
==============

 o Fixed a bug that caused a hang when using GooCanvasWidget with
   accessibility support turned on.
 o Added "scale-to-fit" property to GooCanvasImage, to scale the image
   to the "width" and "height" settings, instead of just clipping.


GooCanvas 0.14	(Mar 15 2009)
==============

 o Added support for tooltips (this means we need GTK+ 2.12).
   (Note that there is a GTK+ bug which will cause problems with
   tooltips on a large canvas. See bug #573294.)
 o Added "x", "y", "width" and "height" properties to items that
   didn't have them.
 o Fixed bug in goo_canvas_convert_from_item_space().
 o Added "scroll-event" signal to GooCanvasItem.


GooCanvas 0.13	(Nov 30 2008)
==============

 o New GooCanvasGrid item for drawing grids on the canvas.
 o Support for static items that don't move as the canvas is zoomed
   and scrolled (this is a bit experimental).
 o Font hinting is not turned off any more - this means smaller text should
   be more readable. Hopefully it doesn't affect text layout.
 o Fixed a few GooCanvasTable drawing bugs.
 o Fixed GooCanvasText drawing, when align is set.
 o Fixed GooCanvasPolyline is_item_at() code, so the fill isn't tested.
 o Added "animation-finished" signals to GooCanvasItem & Model.


GooCanvas 0.12	(Sep 21 2008)
==============

 o Fixed redraws of tables after updates.
 o Fixed problems compiling with libtool 2.2.


GooCanvas 0.11	(Sep 9 2008)
==============

 o Use the tables' fill and stroke colors to paint its grid and background.
 o Emit "children_changed" ATK signal when child items added/removed.
 o Fixed bug when clipping the entire canvas.
 o Got rid of the XXX_DISABLE_DEPRECATED compilation flags.


GooCanvas 0.10	(Apr 27 2008)
==============

 o Added support for a border and grid lines to GooCanvasTable, with
   "horz-grid-line-width", "vert-grid-line-width", "x-border-spacing"
    and "y-border-spacing" properties.
 o Added "clear-background" property to GooCanvas, to allow subclasses
   to paint their own background if desired.
 o Fixed crash when rendering a GooCanvasTable that hasn't been updated.
 o Fixed possible infinite loop in GooCanvasTable layout.
 o Added goo_canvas_text_get_natural_extents() to get the natural extents
   of the text.
 o Made "stroke-color-rgba" and	"fill-color-rgba" properties read/write.
 o Added goo_canvas_item_get_simple_transform() and
   goo_canvas_item_model_get_simple_transform(), which do the opposite of
   the set_simple_transform() functions.
 o Improved documentation on general architecture and creating new items.


GooCanvas 0.9	(Aug 13 2007)
=============

 o Added "scale-x" and "scale-y" properties to GooCanvas, so the
   horizontal and vertical scale can be set independently.
 o Added "integer-layout" property to GooCanvas, so all layout can
   be done to the nearest integer (useful for widgets).
 o Added "automatic-bounds", "bounds-from-origin" and
   "bounds-padding" properties, used to calculate the canvas bounds
   automatically.
 o Added "wrap" property to GooCanvasText, to specify how to wrap
   text.
 o Added demo code to show how to create very large items.
 o Reduced flicker when scrolling.
 o Fixed crash when changing a GooCanvasPathModel.
 o Fixed crash in animation code.
 o Fixed bug that meant the canvas wasn't redrawn properly when the
   bounds were changed.
 o Fixed problem when calculating item sizes before the canvas is
   realized.
 o Fixed problems calculating bounds of items with empty fills or
   strokes.


GooCanvas 0.8	(Apr 3 2007)
=============

 o Added support for "width-for-height" layout - items whose requested
   height changes according to their allocated width (typically text items).
 o Added "background-color" and "background-color-rgb" properties to
   GooCanvas.
 o Added "ellipsize" property to GooCanvasText.
 o Added goo_canvas_item_remove() and goo_canvas_item_model_remove()
   convenience functions to remove an item or model from the canvas.
 o Fixed bug removing widget items.
 o Fixed bug which meant that the fill pattern couldn't be reset to NULL.
 o Fixed the item event signals, so that returning TRUE from a handler
   stops the signal emission.
 o Added a few things that will be needed to support tooltips, when GTK+
   2.12 is available. (Though I don't want to depend on GTK+ 2.12 yet.)
 o Added "const" to arguments, where appropriate.


GooCanvas 0.7	(Feb 27 2007)
=============

 o Added goo_canvas_get_items_at() and goo_canvas_get_items_in_area() to get
   all the items at a given point or in a given area.
 o Use CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_GRAY as the default antialiasing mode, since that is
   what is recommended by cairo for unhinted text.
 o Added "hint-metrics" style property, so people can use hinted text if they
   want to (though they shouldn't change the canvas scale in that case, as
   the bounds of the text item may become incorrect).
 o Unref all objects in dispose methods rather than finalize, to help bindings.
 o Remove embedded widgets properly.
 o Clip GooCanvasTable children if needed.
 o Set the clip path in goo_canvas_render() if needed.
 o Use the ink rects & the logical rects to calculate the text item bounds.
 o Copied GTK+ build stuff for generating goocanvasmarshal.[hc] and
   goocanvasenumtypes.[hc], so hopefully it is easier to build on Windows.
 o Fixed a few other minor bugs.


GooCanvas 0.6	(Feb 17 2007)
=============

 o Major rewrite to make the model optional, so people can choose to have
   either a simple canvas or a model/view canvas. The standard items can be
   used in either scenario.
 o Added support for cascading style properties (things like fill color, stroke
   width, font etc.). Properties use a GQuark for a unique identifier, and a
   GValue for the property value, so they are very flexible.
 o Added GooCanvasTable item to layout child items.
 o Made it much easier to create new items, by subclassing GooCanvasItemSimple
   which handles most of the work. See demo/demo-item.c for a simple item.
 o Added support for different units - pixels, points, inches or millimeters,
   and allow setting of vertical and horizontal resolution (dpi).
 o Added workaround for cairo's 16-bit limit, to support large canvases.
 o Added demo/scalability-demo which creates 100,000 items over a large canvas.
   It takes a few seconds to create all the items, but once created it seems
   to work fast enough.
 o Improved the animation code, supporting relative or absolute values for
   the x, y, scale and rotation.
 o Added "clip-path" and "clip-fill-rule" to specify a clip path for an item.


GooCanvas 0.5	(Oct 10 2006)
=============

 o This was just a development release previewing the new optional model-view
   rewrite.


GooCanvas 0.4	(Aug 24 2006)
=============

 o Many minor changes to support the PyGooCanvas python bindings.
 o Added goo_canvas_view_get_item_view() to get views of particular items,
   to make it easier to setup signal handlers for simple canvases.
   (See demo/simple-demo.c for a demo of this.)
 o Support transforms on item views as well as on items.


GooCanvas 0.3	(Apr 24 2006)
=============

 o New GooCanvasPath item (similar to SVG path element).
 o Accessibility support.
 o Keyboard focus navigation.
 o API documentation.
 o Convenience functions for coordinate conversions.
 o Smooth scrolling & zooming.
 o Zoom-independent text layout.
 o Render part or all of canvas to a cairo_t, for ps/pdf output.
 o New "visibility" and "visibility-threshold" properties for items.
 o New "pointer-events" property specifying which parts of items get events.


GooCanvas 0.2	(Dec 5 2005)
=============

 o Affine transformations for all items.
 o Event handling, including support for pointer grabs.
 o Support for simple animation.
 o Finished port of FooCanvas demo, and added test for pointer grabs.


GooCanvas 0.1	(Nov 17 2005)
=============

 o Basic items working.
 o Model/view split.
 o Interfaces for items & views.
